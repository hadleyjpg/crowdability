                    <p>Dear Reader,</p>
                    <p>Hi, Matt Milner, Founder and CEO of Crowdability here…</p>
                    <p>As you know, I’m about to reveal the details behind a groundbreaking device…</p>
                    <p>Something we’ve been calling, “The COVID-Killer.”</p>
                    <p>And as you’ll learn during this presentation, the groundbreaking technology behind this device was originally developed for the U.S. Military…</p>
                    <p>In fact, it was originally designed to help combat bio-terrorism and chemical attacks…</p>
                    <p>But after the coronavirus appeared earlier this year…</p>
                    <p>The inventor of this technology decided to start a company to fight this pandemic…</p>
                    <p>And that’s when he secured the exclusive patents to this device.</p>
                    <p>Meaning, this is the only company in the world that has the ability to commercialize and sell this technology.</p>
                    <p>And as you’ll discover, not only could this technology help protect people across the globe… and get them back to work…</p>
                    <p>But it could potentially hand investors like you massive profits…</p>
                </div>

            <div class="full">

                    <h2>I’m talking about the chance to turn every</h2>
                    <h2>$1,000 you invest</h2>
                    <h2>into $30,000...</h2>
                    <h2>And every $10,000 into $300,000...</h2>

                <div>
                    <p>And that’s all with just one investment!</p>
                    <p>I know that might sound far fetched…</p>
                    <p>But in a moment, you’ll see why I’m so confident in this forecast.</p>
                    <p>You see, my business partner, Wayne Mulligan and I have spent the past two months diving into scientific research papers and peer-reviewed journals…</p>
                    <p>Basically, we’ve been trying to dig up as much information and data as possible about the device you see here…</p>
                    <p>And what they discovered is extraordinary…</p>
                    <p>Basically, they discovered a classified military-research project…</p>
                    <p>And the goal of this military project was clear:</p>
                    <p><strong>To develop a technology to kill bacteria — in mid-air, instantaneously.</strong></p>
                    <p>Now, initially, this project was designed to fight off bio-terrorist attacks…</p>
                    <p>But as a number of tests and studies eventually proved, this technology has the potential not just to kill bacteria, but to kill various pathogens, too…</p>
                    <p>Pathogens like the coronavirus.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="full">
                <div class="container callout">
                    <h2>Essentially, this device acts like an “Airborne Vaccine”</h2>

            <div class="container main">
                <div>
                    <p>Which is why, after the coronavirus pandemic swept the world earlier this year, the inventor of this technology made a decision…</p>
                    <p>He decided to leverage the technology he’d developed for the military…</p>
                    <p>And use it to create a device to protect ordinary citizens like you…</p>
                    <p>And now he’s started a groundbreaking company — a private startup company — that’s about to release this device commercially…</p>
                    <p>So consumers like you — and like all of us — can be protected from the coronavirus… whether we’re in our home, our office, or even a restaurant or a store.</p>
                    <p>But instead of injecting people like you with a vaccine…</p>
                    <p>It’s designed to eliminate — to actually kill — all the coronavirus molecules in the air around you.</p>
                    <p>Look, our entire team has been researching all of the products and technologies aimed at fighting the coronavirus for months now.</p>
                    <p>And the fact is, we’ve never seen ANYTHING like this device before.</p>
                    <p>And I can almost guarantee that you haven’t either.</p>
                    <p>That’s because this company has secured the exclusive patent to this technology…</p>
                    <p>In fact, here’s the patent — I’m putting it right up on your screen so you can see it in black and white.</p>

                    <p>This company’s business model is very simple and straightforward…</p>
                    <p>Basically, it’s going to sell its products to consumers like us, and to businesses, too.</p>
                    <p>And its devices will cost about $1,000.</p>
                    <p>Now, at first blush, that number might sound high...</p>
                    <p>But that price-point is comparable to the high-end HEPA filters you can buy currently...</p>

                    <p>So, even at the LOWEST end of our forecasts, you’d be selling your stake at a market value of $150 million. 
                    <p>That’s a 2,900% profit.</p>

                            <p>And keep in mind, this is all based on the company capturing far less than 1% of the overall market...</p>
                            <p>And furthermore, it doesn’t take into account how vastly superior this company’s technology is compared to its competitors.</p>
